          <p>
            Our mission at Encounter Web Design is to provide you with web
            solutions to help connect your business with your customers. In
            today's world people first search online to find what they need.
            Without an engaging website, connecting your customers to you, those
            potential customers may be lost to competitors. We can help identify
            your needs and craft a custom solution to make sure that you are
            maximizing your online presence and potential business.
            <br />We can't wait to hear from you so we can plan your next
            project!
          </p>

        <br />
        <p class="sm-paragraph">
          A large number of American businesses still do not have a website or
          have a web presence that is out of date. Our goal is to assist
          companies in getting online. Many do not know how to go about getting
          their business on the web. We will use your initial consultation to
          determine your needs and we will design a custom solution around your
          situation. This solution may involve an eCommerce option, online
          scheduling, ways to communicate with your customers, search engine
          optimization (SEO) and more. We will then generate a custom quote.
          After your new site is launched we are able to assist with hosting,
          ongoing maintenance, and more.<br />

          We pride ourselves on providing the highest level of service. We see
          ourselves as problem solvers and are dedicated to helping you reach
          your goals. We do not take a “one size fits all” approach as no two
          situations are the same.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="sm-heading">
            We can build a starter “store front” website for as low as $500.
            Larger projects will be based on a custom quote. We will tailor a
            solution that is specific to your needs and will work within your
            budget.
